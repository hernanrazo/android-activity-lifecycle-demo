An android app demo that showcases the android activity lifecycle. There are two activities, MainActivity and secondActivity. Using the logcat and log class, this app shows the user when each callback is called in both activities. Both activities have a button that is used to switch between the two and showcase how the lifecycles interact in each respective activity and when switching between the two.
